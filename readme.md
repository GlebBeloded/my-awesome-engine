# My awesome engine

This is the best open source game-engine you can find on the market, but for an untrained eye it may seem like a hello world project with extensive testing.

### Prerequisites

You need linux with c++ compiler as well as python interpreter in order to run this.

```
sudo [your package manager] cppcheck cmake python3
```

### Installing

In order to install this you just need to run a few commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

if make didn't print anything red you're good to go!

## Running the tests

There are python tests for each module, you can run them from inside the module you want to test or just run from tests.py from project root to test all modules.


### And coding style tests
